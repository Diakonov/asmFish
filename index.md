### Quo vadis? asmFish
If the original objective for this project was to rewrite SF in assembly, it was fulfilled with a vengeance. Now asmFish is faster, leaner, and meaner than SF. The program gathered a small fan club of people who use asmFish instead of SF, taking advantage of its greater speed and counting on regular updates. Regularity of updates is a goal that we continue to fulfil.

However, there is also a group of sceptics that view asmFish as a clone of SF with nothing original. They say that asmFish is just another compile of SF. Although many of them acknowledge the hard work of rewriting SF into assembly, they think that all this has been in vain, because the same effect can be achieved by just rewriting only the critical parts in assembly.

Partly, these sceptics are right. Except speed, omission of piece tables, adding the possibility for large pages, and numa awareness, asmFish has little extra to brag about. On the other hand, asmFish has great unused potential to become the strongest chess playing entity in the Universe (no exaggeration at all). In other words, we need to move forward into new territory, unoccupied by other chess engines. One direction is outlined above by Ipman (one of the finest testers there is, btw) - making a cluster of connected or distributed computers playing asmFish, similar to Fishtesting framework.

Another direction, which none of the serious chess programs at the moment has taken (except Giraffe which was abandoned) is the much talked about neural networks. A unique opportunity is that there is a template of a neural network written in assembly -- Neural64: https://board.flatassembler.net/topic.php?t=6020 which seems to be versatile enough. In spite of its name, it can work also on 32-bit CPU, albeit more slowly. Coupling Neural64 (or some other, more recent, AI software) with asmFish would create a chess monster who learns and becomes stronger the more it plays. At present, the main stumbling block in computer chess development is the tuning of parameters for evaluation functions. Automating this process will cause a revolution in computer chess.

Combining the two ideas, imagine a distributed network playing 24/7 chess using a program that itself is a neural network. This self-learning entity is capable to reinvent chess itself. We can see play that is unfathomable even for a chess genius, like sacrificing the Queen on move 2 and winning the game on move 380.

We can leave pedantFish to be the SF copy, following closely the SF updates, monitoring the bench equality, etc., and develop asmFish in the above directions taking the freedom to diverge benches, evaluations, adding the new functions and features.
